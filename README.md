# LightBoard
The LightBoard is a sign that I'm making for my dad, hopefully in time for christmas, using spare ws2815 led strips.
It will be able to function as a sign at my dad's work that can display scrolling text or animations.
It should be able to attach to the wall using those velcro sticky thingys.
