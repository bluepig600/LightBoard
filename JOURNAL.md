## 1. Research and started bom (2.0 hrs)
I did research on the components I'll need to make this.
I went through many options, I could use a esp32 and a step down voltage thing to use the 12v power supply from the led strip for the esp32. Or I could just use the vin pin on the esp32 which was much easier when I found one that had a vin pin. I also could use a voltage step up thing to step up the data pins to 5v but I have my house lights not using one and it works well.
I also created my bom using the guide so it totals it for me.
I combined what I did today and yesterday.

## 2. Worked on case (3.5 hrs)
I worked on the case for the sign.
I've decided to call this "LightBoard".
The case was really annoying as I'm using FreeCAD and it's my second time making a 3d model.
I was going to make an individual spot for each led to go in but freecad was adding and removing a bunch of constraints while I was making it so I just decided to not do that part. I wasted around 2 hours on that.

## 3. Edited 3d model (0.6 hrs)

I edited the 3d model of the case so I could have the power cable coming out.
And the esp32 could fit inside.
I also realized I'm going to need some wire for this so I added that to the bill of materials.
I also edited the thickness of the case between where the leds strip is going to be and the outside because the light wasn't going to be able to go through there. I also exported all the files too.
